							“People have an enormous tendency to resist change. They love to say, 'We've always
							done it this way.' I try to fight that.” —Grace Hopper

							Grace Hopper joined the U.S. Navy during World War II and was assigned to program the
							Mark I computer. She continued to work in computing after the war, leading the team
							that created the first computer language compiler, which led to the popular
							<strong><a id="cobol-link" href="#cobol">COBOL language</a></strong
							>.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Hopper noticed that many people did not further invest their time in computer science
							because they found it hard to understand Executable Machine Code. This lead to
							Hopper’s creation of the compiler; which today translates high-level programming
							languages (such as Java or Python) to a language in which computers could understand.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Hopper also coined the word ‘bug.’ In the 1940s, her team was working on a computer
							glitch, only to discover the problem was a bug—a live bug, that is: a moth stuck in an
							electrical switch. Hence, they ‘debugged’ the first computer.

				<h2>WHAT IS COBOL PROGRAMMING?</h2>
				<div class="box" id="last">
					<div class="half">
						<p>
							COBOL is a high-level programming language primarily used for business applications.
							At the time of its creation, it was the first popular language designed to
							be Operating System agnostic (can run on any Operating System) and is still in use in
							many financial and business applications today.
						</p>
						<p>
							COBOL is also still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe
							computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was officially standardized in 1968 and has received four major revisions over the
							years. Expansions include support for structured and object-oriented programming. The
							current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014.
